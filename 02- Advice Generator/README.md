## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I had a little knowledge about using fetch for APIs but this project helped me get more familiar with it! I also learnt how to edit an svg image.

### Continued development

I would like to create more projects using APIs and to get more pratice of fetch in javascript. Also, I want to work more on error handling!

### Useful resources
