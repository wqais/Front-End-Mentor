## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learnt a lot of new things in this challenge!
Firstly, I got to practice with the -webkit properties and the -moz properties as well. I learnt to clear default styles and customize elements as per the requirements!
Then I worked with multiple background images which seemed difficult at first but I got comfortable with it once i got my hands on it.
I also learnt to manipulate DOM using javascript by taking input from user. 

### Continued development

I would like to get more comfortable with flexbox and to create elements that work similarly on all browers.
